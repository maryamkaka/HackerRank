## Graphs

### Definitions
````
Undirected Graph:
  A     B
   \   /    
     C     F
   /   \
  D --- E
````

- consists of nodes/vertices
- nodes may or may not be connected to each other
- __edge__: connecting lines between each node (undirected graph)
- __arc__: connecting lines from one node to the next (directed graph)
- __degree (of a vertex)__: number of edges connected to a vertex
- __Max/Min degree (of a graph)__: Maximum/Minimum degree of graph
- __degree sequence__: sorted (from max -> min) sequence of vertex degrees
- __graph density__: ratio of number of edges to total number of edges
- __complete graph__: every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge (ie every node is connected to every other node directly)
- __connected graphs__: every pair of vertices in a graph is connected
- __tree__: undirected graph which contains no cycles
- __forest__: disjoint union of trees
